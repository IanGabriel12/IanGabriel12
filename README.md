# Hi, I am Ian 😁
I love computer science theory and competitive programing. I am experienced in web development and now i am looking for a job in the area, maybe some freelancing projects.

Right now I am migrating my stack to Java. I want to focus on back-end development using Spring Boot framework. You can see what I am studying here.

## Some things I am doing right now
- 🖥️: I have been teaching to the freshers some computer science theory for programming contests, in preparation to the Olympiads and the ICPC. You can see some classes in my youtube channel (the classes are in portuguese).
